My audio narrative "A Night Out" goes through the getting ready and going to a resturant of four friends. It begins in an apartment and then as the friends meet up they make their way out on to the street towards the bus stop. Then once the bus arrives they get on and sit and wait till they get to the resturant. It follows them then walking from the bus stop to the resturant and then once inside ask the hostess for a table.

I have worked with editing audios sectioning out parts of the audio to make sections louder or softer. I have also tried to make each sound clip fade in and out of eachtoher smoothly to make a clean transitions from one place to the next. I have sourced audio from freesound.or and soundcloud, while also recording audios myself. One other effect I have done is make echo, left-right paning, and noise removal.
